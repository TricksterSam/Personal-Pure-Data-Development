 ## Rhythm Prism 3
 A suite of modular synth tools designed for generative music. All modules work with signals (0 to 1 or -1 to 1) in the same manner as modular synth voltage standards (e.g. 0.1 = 1 octave). Includes an oscillator, envelope generators, filter, samplers, shift register, quantizer, offsets, attenuators, voltage to MIDI file recording, 8-channel audio recording, and more!
